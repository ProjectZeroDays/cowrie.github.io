      <description>Since summer 2014 I&amp;rsquo;ve been working on extensions and contributions to the well known Kippo honeypot developed by desaster.
I noticed some SSH attacks against my systems were not logged in full detail and I started to work on additional logging, from there I&amp;rsquo;ve added &amp;lsquo;ssh exec commands&amp;rsquo; support, SFTP support, SCP support, direct-tcpip (proxying) support and many other features.
To distinguish this from the original software, I have now renamed the system to &amp;quot;Cowrie&amp;quot;.</description>
